# racecars

A simple code doodle to explore blending multiple animation techniques (CGI, CSS, GIF, multi-plane) into one experience.

It uses cars built in Blender as 3D models, then exported to tif, with alpha channel, then animated with a subtle bouncing effect in Photoshop, and exported as animated gifs. They are then pulled into the HTML and animated via CSS. The road was created as a static graphic in Photoshop, and the yellow line, trees and shrubs are created in CSS and animated (via CSS) using traditional multi-plane animation techniques, to describe distance and perspective.
